# Depth Prediction
This module is used for depth prediction from a monocular image using the principles of Transfer Learning.

# Dependencies
[pyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)

# Steps to run the file 
1) Clone this Directory

2) Run the test.py file (Directory Should be this)
  > python test.py
  
You can two window one is the RGB image and the other is the Gray scaled depth map.

# Various concepts used
1) CUDA    - CUDA optimization for motion tracking
2) Transfer Learning - Depth Prediction 

# Results 
Depth map from a monocular image (Web-Cam)
